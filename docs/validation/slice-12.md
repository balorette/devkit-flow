## How to read this

Each prediction is written **before** the corresponding pack content is authored, per `CLAUDE.md` working principle 4. If behavior diverges from a prediction during the dogfood, **the pack content needs revision — not the prediction.**

The dogfood target is Enterprise API, which has an open PR (#141) from the run that produced slice 12's findings.

### Prediction T1 — Phase F3 halts on an unresolvable symbol

**Setup:** A plan whose Step 2 signature block names `CaseLayout` where the codebase defines `ReconciliationCaseLayout`, and whose conventions table names `build_manifest_conflict_detail` where the codebase defines `manifest_409_detail`.

**Predicted:** `/plan` reaches Phase F3, reports both names as UNRESOLVED with the near-miss suggestion for the first, and does **not** proceed to Phase G's commit proposal until the plan is corrected. The conventions-table name is caught, not just the signature-block one.

**Why this is the prediction that matters:** the mid-feature partial fix during the 0.11.0 run covered signature blocks only, and instance five was in the conventions table. A Phase F3 that catches four of five is the same defect relocated.

**Secondary check:** a plan that names a symbol it *introduces* must not halt. The phase's whole output is the distinction between a deliberate new name and a wrong one.
